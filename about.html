            <p class="about">I lived in the fabulous Florida Keys my whole life before moving to Naples, Florida, in 2004. Growing up in such a uniquely beautiful and fragile environment has instilled in me a very deep love for all of Florida's incredible and varied ecosystems. Although I'm certainly not opposed to new life experiences, at this point I can't imagine living anywhere else.</p>
        <p class="about">My hobbies include cooking (and eating, of course), outdoor adventures, casual birding, and plenty of reading. Cats are also an unfortunate obsession of mine, and I try to foster orphaned kittens from the local humane society whenever I have spare time. I must admit this results in an embarrassing number of cat photos on my phone and computer...
        <p class="about">On a more serious note, for as long as I can remember, I have been captivated by the written word. A few of my favorite authors are Sylvia Plath, Charles Bukowski, and Ovid, among many, many others. Pursuing degrees (and a career) in English and Journalism is a way for me to hopefully leave my own literary mark on the world, however small it may be.</p>
        <p class="about">I created this site from scratch for a web design class as a part of my Master's program. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach me at my <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page.</p>
